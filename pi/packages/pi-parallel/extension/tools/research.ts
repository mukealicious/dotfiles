  description: "Run an asynchronous deep-research job on a topic using parallel.ai, which searches the web, reads multiple sources, and synthesizes findings into a structured markdown report with cited sources. Unlike web_search (which returns a list of pages), this tool reads and reasons across many sources to produce a cohesive answer. The tool starts a research job, polls for completion automatically, and returns the full synthesized report with source citations. Use this for open-ended questions that require cross-source synthesis: 'what are the tradeoffs of X vs Y', 'current state of Z', 'comprehensive overview of W'. Use web_search instead for quick factual lookups or when you just need to find a specific page. The speed parameter controls depth: fast (default) is cheap and usually sufficient, best produces a thorough report but takes significantly longer.",
